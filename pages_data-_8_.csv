REUTERS/Tatiana Meel  Acquire Licensing Rights MOSCOW, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Russian fuel producers have been told by the government to prepare for the scrapping of all remaining restrictions on the export of diesel and gasoline, three industry sources told Reuters on Thursday. Russia, the world's top seaborne exporter of diesel, introduced a ban on fuel exports on Sept. 21 to tackle high domestic prices and shortages. The government eased restrictions on Oct. 6, allowing the export of diesel by pipeline, but kept measures on gasoline exports in place. Overseas supplies of gasoline by trucks and railways are also prohibited. Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on Wednesday said that Russia was considering lifting the export ban on some grades of gasoline. They told the producers that exports will be opened up from next week, said a Russian oil company source who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of such decisions. Another industry source said the ban would be lifted next week. They promised to lift the exports ban next week. In regards to this promise, we have formed an export schedule and a plan for refining, said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The Russian energy ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Diesel is Russia's biggest oil product export, at about 35 million metric tons last year. Almost three quarters of that was transported via pipeline. Russia also exported 4.8 million tons of gasoline in 2022. Another company source said that a gasoline glut had emerged because of the restrictions. It's a low season now; we can't sell so much on the domestic market, he said. Officials have said the ban would be lifted once the domestic market stabilises. Analysts had expected the restrictions to be scrapped after completion of the recent grain harvesting season. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Sunday said that Russia would continue an additional voluntary supply cut of 300,000 barrels per day from its crude oil and petroleum product exports until the end of December, as previously announced.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - A ransomware attack on Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) disrupted some trades in the U.S. Treasury market on Thursday, the Treasury Department said. In ransomware attacks, hackers encrypt an organization's systems and demand ransom payments in exchange for unlocking them. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack. The Financial Times reported earlier on Thursday that the U.S. Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) told members that ICBC (601398.SS) had been hit by ransomware that disrupted the U.S. Treasury market by preventing it from settling trades on behalf of other market players. We are aware of the cybersecurity issue and are in regular contact with key financial sector participants, in addition to federal regulators. We continue to monitor the situation, a Treasury spokesperson said in a response to a question about the FT report. ICBC, China's largest commercial lender by assets, was beginning to restore services as of Thursday afternoon, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the ransomware attack, which paralyses computer systems unless a payment is made. The Treasury market appeared to be functioning normally on Thursday, according to LSEG data. SIFMA declined to comment. ICBC was not immediately available to comment.

REUTERS/Monica Almeida Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - A California federal judge said on Thursday that he would dismiss, for now, part of a copyright lawsuit brought by comedian Sarah Silverman and other authors against Meta Platforms (META.O) over its artificial-intelligence system Llama. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said at a hearing that he would grant Meta's motion to dismiss the authors' allegations that text generated by Llama infringes their copyrights. Chhabria also indicated that he would give the authors permission to amend most of their claims. Meta has not yet challenged the authors' central claim in the case that it violated their rights by using their books as part of the data used to train Llama. I understand your core theory, Chhabria told attorneys for the authors. Your remaining theories of liability I don't understand even a little bit. The lawsuit is one of several brought by copyright owners against tech companies over their generative AI systems. The cases largely revolve around the high-stakes question of whether the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train AI is allowable. The authors sued Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI in July. They argued that the companies infringed their copyrights by using their books to train AI language models, and separately said that the models' output also violates their copyrights. Chhabria criticized the second claim on Thursday, casting doubt on the idea that the text generated by Llama copies or resembles their works. When I make a query of Llama, I'm not asking for a copy of Sarah Silverman's book – I'm not even asking for an excerpt, Chhabria said. The authors also argued that Llama itself is an infringing work. Chhabria said the theory would have to mean that if you put the Llama language model next to Sarah Silverman's book, you would say they're similar. That makes my head explode when I try to understand that, Chhabria said. The judge said he would dismiss most of the claims with leave to amend, and that he would dismiss them again if the authors failed to argue that Llama's output was substantially similar to their works. OpenAI separately asked the court to trim the authors' lawsuit against it in August. That motion is set to be argued next month. Another federal judge in California last month rejected some similar claims brought by visual artists against Stability AI, Midjourney and DeviantArt. The judge found that their generative AI output was likely not similar enough to the artists' work to infringe. The case is Kadrey v.

REUTERS/Victoria Klesty/Illustration  Acquire Licensing Rights CHICAGO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A new class of weight loss drugs is transforming the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could extend to equally hard-to-treat areas like substance abuse, according to speakers at the Reuters Events Total Health conference in Chicago this week. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said Eli Lilly (LLY.N) could begin selling its drug tirzepatide for weight loss, making it the second obesity drug in a class known as GLP-1s. The drug, Zepbound, is already sold under the brand name Mounjaro as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk's (NOVOb.CO) Wegovy, or semaglutide, was approved for obesity in 2021 and is sold as Ozempic for diabetes. Drugs in the class, which are also under development at a number of other pharmaceutical companies, are designed to mimic action of the GLP-1 hormone to regulate blood sugar, slow digestion and suppress appetite. Studies of Novo's Wegovy showed that it led to 15% weight loss over 68 weeks, while Lilly's drug, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, demonstrated weight loss of more than 22% over 72 weeks. This opens up really some dramatic new opportunities in terms of control of the satiety region of the brain, but also other regions where addiction might be controlled, said Lawrence Tabak, principal deputy director at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), during an interview at Total Health on Wednesday. He said NIH-supported studies are still very much a work in progress, and the drugs can cause side effects, but it does open up a whole new set of possibilities to control things like obesity, metabolism in general, perhaps other addictive conditions. Drugstore chain Walgreens is seeing enormous demand for GLP-1s, said John Driscoll, president, U.S. healthcare at Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O). I think these drugs are going to change the way people experience healthcare, he said, while noting that reimbursement by health insurers has not yet caught up with demand. The drugs have U.S. list prices of more than $1,000 a month. As time progresses, you typically wind up with drugs that may cost less over time, the NIH's Tabak said. He also said the potential for lower overall healthcare costs should be considered. If you are able to get a better control of obesity in this country, the savings on the back end due to reductions in cardiovascular disease, and then, you know, related conditions will be quite vast, Tabak said. Much has been made of the impact the new weight loss drugs might have on consumer habits such as snack food purchases, but Driscoll said Walgreens has not seen that yet. If they do it's probably a good thing for U.S. health care and our population and we would happily adjust to what the consumers want to buy if that happens, he said. I think we are just at the cusp of understanding beyond obesity.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday will weigh final approval of JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N) $290 million settlement with women who said Jeffrey Epstein abused them, and that the largest U.S. bank turned a blind eye to the late financier's sex trafficking. At Thursday's hearing at 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff will consider an objection to the settlement by 16 U.S. states and Washington D.C., which said it could limit their ability to seek damages arising from sex trafficking by Epstein and his associates. Rakoff had granted preliminary approval in June, calling it a really fine settlement. The settlement covered more than 100 women, led by a former ballet dancer known as Jane Doe 1, who said Epstein abused them. It followed embarrassing disclosures that JPMorgan ignored internal warnings and overlooked red flags about Epstein because he had been a valuable client. Epstein was a JPMorgan client from 1998 to 2013. The bank kept him on even after he was arrested in 2006 on prostitution charges and pleaded guilty two years later. JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. At the hearing, Rakoff will also hear from one of Epstein's accusers, Sarah Ransome, who has argued that the settlement is too small and does not explain how funds will be distributed. JPMorgan in September agreed to pay $75 million to settle related claims by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands. Rakoff on Oct. 20 gave final approval to a similar $75 million settlement between Epstein's accusers and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), where Epstein banked after JPMorgan fired him. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at age 66 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. New York City's medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and longtime associate, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in December 2021 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for him to abuse. She is appealing her conviction.

Tesla Chile was registered and published in the Official Gazette on Sept. 28 and includes the import, export, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of vehicles, especially electric vehicles.

"8","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fierce-fighting-gaza-city-us-says-palestinians-must-govern-gaza-post-war-2023-11-09/","GAZA/WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Israel has agreed to pause military operations in parts of north Gaza for four hours a day from Thursday, the White House said, raising hopes of a respite in more than a month of fighting that has killed thousands and stoked fears of regional conflict. The pauses, that would allow people to flee along two humanitarian corridors and could be used for the release of hostages, were significant first steps, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. But as night approached, there were no immediate reports of a lull in fighting raging among the ruined buildings in the north of the Gaza Strip. There was also no direct confirmation from Israel, which spoke more generally of measures that appeared to correspond to arrangements already in place. We are undertaking localised and pinpoint measures to enable the exit of Palestinian civilians from Gaza City southward, so that we do not harm them. These things do not detract from the war fighting, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. Israeli forces completely encircled Gaza City in recent days and the military has been allowing civilians safe passage along the main route south for three or four hours each day, with ever growing numbers of families opting to escape. There would be no full ceasefire for now, Gallant told reporters. We will not stop fighting as long as our hostages are in Gaza and as long as we have not completed our mission, which is toppling the Hamas regime and eliminating its military and governance capabilities, Gallant said. Taher Al-Nono, a political adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, said on Thursday that unspecified negotiations were continuing and no deal had been reached with Israel so far. Israel unleashed its assault on Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. It was the single worst day of bloodshed in Israel's 75-year history and drew international condemnation of Hamas and sympathy and support for Israel. But Israel's retaliation in the Hamas-ruled enclave caused great concern as a humanitarian catastrophe unfolded. Palestinian officials said 10,812 Gaza residents had been killed as of Thursday, about 40% of them children, in air and artillery strikes while basic supplies are running out and areas laid waste by unrelenting Israeli bombardments. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters he had sought a longer pause than four hours. I've asked for a pause longer than three days, he said as he left the White House. Asked if he was frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said, It's taken a little longer than I hoped. Earlier, a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the heads of the CIA and Israel's Mossad intelligence agency chiefs met with the Qatari prime minister in Doha on Thursday to discuss the parameters of a deal for hostage releases and a pause in Hamas-Israel fighting.

REUTERS/Mohammed Salem  Acquire Licensing Rights In northern Gaza, Israeli forces fought Hamas militants and inched their way closer to two big hospitals as the plight of civilians in the besieged Palestinian territory worsened. Thousands more Palestinians were fleeing from the embattled north to the south along a perilous frontline path littered with bodies after Israel told them to evacuate, people on the route said. But many are staying in the north, packed into the Al Shifa Hospital and al-Quds Hospital as ground battles rage around them and more Israeli air strikes rain down from above. Israel says its Hamas foes have command centres embedded in the hospitals. In Paris, officials from about 80 countries and organisations were meeting to coordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza and find ways to help wounded civilians escape the siege, now in its second month. Without a ceasefire, lifting of siege and indiscriminate bombarding and warfare, the haemorrhage of human lives will continue, Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said before the White House announcement. Israel and its main backer the United States say a full ceasefire would benefit Hamas. Residents in Gaza City, a Hamas stronghold, said Israeli tanks were stationed around the area. Both sides reported inflicting heavy casualties on one another in intense street battles. Israel, which has vowed to wipe out Hamas, says 33 of its soldiers have been killed in its ground operation as they advanced into the heart of Gaza City. Hamas has long vowed to destroy Israel. Thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge at Al Shifa hospital inside Gaza City despite Israel's orders to evacuate the area it has encircled. They are sheltering in tents in the hospital grounds and say they have nowhere else to go. The U.N. humanitarian office OCHA said Israel had again told residents of the north to move south, and that shelling around the main road continued, endangering evacuees. We saw decomposed bodies, people from civilian cars, civilians like us, not military cars or resistance men, Khaled Abu Issa said after crossing into the south with his family at Wadi Gaza. Another resident, who asked not to be named, said he had crossed with his wife and six children. You have to hold your ID card in your hand and raise it as you go past the Israeli tanks and then walk several more kilometres searching for a lift, he said. Southern areas have also come under regular attack. In Khan Younis, Gaza's main southern city, residents picked through the rubble and debris of a building destroyed by an Israeli air strike, hoping to find survivors, on Thursday morning, witnesses said. Tensions have also soared on other faultlines. Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah said it fired missiles over the border into Israel, and Israel's military said it responded with artillery fire. Ten Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in a raid on Jenin city and refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. Israel's military said it was conducting counter-terrorism raids.

REUTERS/Ilan Rosenberg/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Reuters denied on Thursday suggestions by media advocacy group HonestReporting that it and other international news organisations had prior knowledge of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians and soldiers. The Israeli government demanded explanations from Reuters and three other news groups regarding the HonestReporting article which questioned their work with Gaza-based photojournalists during the Hamas assault. HonestReporting, which describes itself on its website as a charitable organisation with a mission to combat ideological prejudice in journalism and the media, as it impacts Israel, said it was not accusing Reuters of collusion but was raising ethical questions about news coverage. Reuters categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with Hamas on Oct. 7, Reuters said, responding to the HonestReporting article and subsequent allegations by Israeli government officials. Reuters acquired photographs from two Gaza-based freelance photographers who were at the border on the morning of Oct. 7, with whom it did not have a prior relationship, it said. The photographs published by Reuters were taken two hours after Hamas fired rockets across southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border. Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the HonestReporting article, Reuters added. Israeli government spokesperson Nitzan Chen said in a statement that Israel was demanding explanations from Reuters and the other news organisations regarding the HonestReporting article, saying what the report had described crosses every red line, professional and moral. The Israeli prime minister's office said it viewed with utmost gravity the suggestion that journalists working with international media had joined in covering the Hamas attack. These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics, it said. HonestReporting wrote on social media platform X that it was raising questions about news coverage, including whether the photojournalists had prior knowledge and, if so, whether the news groups were notified before the attack. We did not accuse Reuters of collusion, it said. We quite rightly raised some serious ethical issues regarding news outlets' association with these freelancers and asked important and relevant questions that everyone deserves answers to. The Associated Press (AP), which was among the news groups named by HonestReporting, said: The Associated Press had no knowledge of the Oct. 7 attacks before they happened. The first pictures AP received from any freelancer show they were taken more than an hour after the attacks began. No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time. Reuters said in its statement that it remained committed to delivering independent, accurate and unbiased news around the world, in keeping with its Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
