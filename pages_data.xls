REUTERS/Victoria Klesty/Illustration  Acquire Licensing Rights CHICAGO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A new class of weight loss drugs is transforming the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could extend to equally hard-to-treat areas like substance abuse, according to speakers at the Reuters Events Total Health conference in Chicago this week. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said Eli Lilly (LLY.N) could begin selling its drug tirzepatide for weight loss, making it the second obesity drug in a class known as GLP-1s. The drug, Zepbound, is already sold under the brand name Mounjaro as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk's (NOVOb.CO) Wegovy, or semaglutide, was approved for obesity in 2021 and is sold as Ozempic for diabetes. Drugs in the class, which are also under development at a number of other pharmaceutical companies, are designed to mimic action of the GLP-1 hormone to regulate blood sugar, slow digestion and suppress appetite. Studies of Novo's Wegovy showed that it led to 15% weight loss over 68 weeks, while Lilly's drug, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, demonstrated weight loss of more than 22% over 72 weeks. ""This opens up really some dramatic new opportunities in terms of control of the satiety region of the brain, but also other regions where addiction might be controlled,"" said Lawrence Tabak, principal deputy director at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), during an interview at Total Health on Wednesday. He said NIH-supported studies are still ""very much a work in progress,"" and the drugs can cause side effects, but ""it does open up a whole new set of possibilities to control things like obesity, metabolism in general, perhaps other addictive conditions."" Drugstore chain Walgreens is seeing ""enormous demand"" for GLP-1s, said John Driscoll, president, U.S. healthcare at Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O). ""I think these drugs are going to change the way people experience healthcare,"" he said, while noting that reimbursement by health insurers has not yet caught up with demand. The drugs have U.S. list prices of more than $1,000 a month. ""As time progresses, you typically wind up with drugs that may cost less over time,"" the NIH's Tabak said. He also said the potential for lower overall healthcare costs should be considered. ""If you are able to get a better control of obesity in this country, the savings on the back end due to reductions in cardiovascular disease, and then, you know, related conditions will be quite vast,"" Tabak said. Much has been made of the impact the new weight loss drugs might have on consumer habits such as snack food purchases, but Driscoll said Walgreens has not seen that yet. ""If they do it's probably a good thing for U.S. health care and our population and we would happily adjust to what the consumers want to buy if that happens,"" he said. ""I think we are just at the cusp of understanding beyond obesity.""

REUTERS/Tatiana Meel  Acquire Licensing Rights MOSCOW, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Russian fuel producers have been told by the government to prepare for the scrapping of all remaining restrictions on the export of diesel and gasoline, three industry sources told Reuters on Thursday. Russia, the world's top seaborne exporter of diesel, introduced a ban on fuel exports on Sept. 21 to tackle high domestic prices and shortages. The government eased restrictions on Oct. 6, allowing the export of diesel by pipeline, but kept measures on gasoline exports in place. Overseas supplies of gasoline by trucks and railways are also prohibited. Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on Wednesday said that Russia was considering lifting the export ban on some grades of gasoline. ""They told the producers that exports will be opened up from next week,"" said a Russian oil company source who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of such decisions. Another industry source said the ban would be lifted next week. ""They promised to lift the exports ban next week. In regards to this promise, we have formed an export schedule and a plan for refining,"" said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The Russian energy ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Diesel is Russia's biggest oil product export, at about 35 million metric tons last year. Almost three quarters of that was transported via pipeline. Russia also exported 4.8 million tons of gasoline in 2022. Another company source said that a gasoline glut had emerged because of the restrictions. ""It's a low season now; we can't sell so much on the domestic market,"" he said. Officials have said the ban would be lifted once the domestic market stabilises. Analysts had expected the restrictions to be scrapped after completion of the recent grain harvesting season. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Sunday said that Russia would continue an additional voluntary supply cut of 300,000 barrels per day from its crude oil and petroleum product exports until the end of December, as previously announced.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday will weigh final approval of JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N) $290 million settlement with women who said Jeffrey Epstein abused them, and that the largest U.S. bank turned a blind eye to the late financier's sex trafficking. At Thursday's hearing at 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff will consider an objection to the settlement by 16 U.S. states and Washington D.C., which said it could limit their ability to seek damages arising from sex trafficking by Epstein and his associates. Rakoff had granted preliminary approval in June, calling it a ""really fine settlement."" The settlement covered more than 100 women, led by a former ballet dancer known as Jane Doe 1, who said Epstein abused them. It followed embarrassing disclosures that JPMorgan ignored internal warnings and overlooked red flags about Epstein because he had been a valuable client. Epstein was a JPMorgan client from 1998 to 2013. The bank kept him on even after he was arrested in 2006 on prostitution charges and pleaded guilty two years later. JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. At the hearing, Rakoff will also hear from one of Epstein's accusers, Sarah Ransome, who has argued that the settlement is too small and does not explain how funds will be distributed. JPMorgan in September agreed to pay $75 million to settle related claims by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands, pending Rakoff's approval. Rakoff on Oct. 20 gave final approval to a similar $75 million settlement between Epstein's accusers and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), where Epstein banked after JPMorgan fired him. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at age 66 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. New York City's medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and longtime associate, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in December 2021 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for him to abuse.

Value1_4,https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-jobless-claims-fall-latest-week-still-strong-labor-market-2023-11-09/,"[1/2]A ""now hiring"" sign is displayed outside Taylor Party and Equipment Rentals in Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S., September 1, 2022. REUTERS/Brian Snyder  Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits edged down last week, signaling that layoffs remain low even as the still-strong job market shows some signs of cooling. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 4 from an upwardly revised 220,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 218,000 claims for the latest week. Meanwhile, the rolls of those receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, rose for a seventh straight week to 1.834 million during the week ending Oct. 28, the highest level since April, the claims report showed. Some economists contend the rise in continuing claims reflects difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Others, however, say the persistence of the recent rise indicates that while new layoffs remain subdued, those out of work are experiencing a harder time finding a new job. That would be consistent with the latest hiring data showing the job market is cooling. Last week the Labor Department reported the pace of hiring slowed in October and unemployment ticked higher, although joblessness - at 3.9% last month - remains historically low. A separate report showed that there were 1.5 job openings for every unemployed person in September, down from around 2-to-1 when the job market was the most tight last year. The claims data adds to the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep interest rates on hold for now, economists said. ""The claims data are consistent with a job market that is cooling enough to keep rate hikes off the table for now, but still too strong to make rate cuts a consideration any time,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note. ""The Fed needs to see enough softening of labor market conditions and wage growth to be persuaded that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%."" The U.S. central bank held interest rates steady last week but left the door open to a further increase in borrowing costs in a nod to the economy's resilience. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range to beat back inflation that last year topped 7% by its preferred measure. It has since fallen to 3.4% but has made little further downward progress in recent months, although some underlying measures have continued to decline. The Fed meets once more this year, in mid-December, and interest rate futures markets reflect less than a 10% probability that policymakers will raise rates then, according to CME Group's Fed Watch tool. Indeed, rates markets foresee no more increases, with cuts priced in by the summer of 2024. Vanden Houten, however, said she expects job market conditions to soften slowly, and now expects the first Fed rate cut to happen in September rather than May as she had previously forecast.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz  Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators plan to introduce a bipartisan bill on Thursday that would require private equity firms to make public how much they invest in China and other countries of concern. The bill, set to be introduced by Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican Senator Rick Scott, is the latest effort to track U.S. investments in China. ""The American people deserve to know where and how their savings are being invested,"" Casey said in a statement. The United States has sought to crack down on U.S. investment in China over fears U.S. dollars and know-how are aiding Beijing's technological advances to modernize its military. U.S. private investment firms have poured more than $80 billion into China between 2018 and 2022, some via pension plans, according to Casey's office. The new congressional measure would require private equity funds to annually disclose assets invested in China, Iran, Russia and North Korea to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which would then be required to make public a report based on the information. It would also require disclosure of certain information about private security sales. Rick Scott's office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Casey has also co-sponsored a measure that would require government notification of investments in certain sensitive technology sectors in China. That measure has been added as an amendment to the Senate's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and may or may not survive reconciliation with the House's version. The new bill also comes in the wake of an executive order on outbound investment to prohibit some U.S. investments in China in semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and require notification of others.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has blocked the U.S. Department of Justice from pursuing an administrative case accusing Elon Musk's SpaceX of illegally refusing to hire refugees and asylum recipients. U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera in Brownsville, Texas said in a written order late Wednesday that administrative judges at the Justice Department who hear cases involving anti-immigrant bias were not properly appointed. Olvera blocked the department's case, which was filed in August, from moving forward pending the outcome of SpaceX's September lawsuit claiming the administrative case violates the U.S. Constitution. The Justice Department and SpaceX did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. The Justice Department claims that from at least 2018 to 2022, the rocket and satellite company routinely discouraged asylum recipients and refugees from applying for jobs, and refused to consider or hire them. In job postings and public statements, SpaceX wrongly claimed that under federal regulations known as export control laws, it could hire only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, known as green card holders, the Justice Department said. The department cited a June 2020 post on X, formerly called Twitter, by Musk that said: ""U.S. law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are advanced weapons technology."" SpaceX has denied wrongdoing and said that it has hired hundreds of non-U.S. citizens. In its lawsuit, the company claims that administrative judges are appointed by the U.S. attorney general but have powers that should be reserved only for officials appointed by the president. Olvera on Wednesday agreed. Because federal law does not give the attorney general the ability to review the judges' decisions, the Constitution requires that they be appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, the judge said.

Value1_8,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fierce-fighting-gaza-city-us-says-palestinians-must-govern-gaza-post-war-2023-11-09/,"GAZA/WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Israel has agreed to pause military operations in northern Gaza for four hours a day from Thursday, the White House said, in the first sign of a respite in more than a month of fighting that has killed thousands and stoked fears of a regional conflict. The pauses, that would allow people to flee along two humanitarian corridors and could be used for the release of hostages, were significant first steps, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. Minutes later, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters he was pushing for even longer pauses in Gaza to get hostages held by Hamas Islamist militants out. Asked if he was frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said, ""It's taken a little longer than I hoped."" Taher Al-Nono, a political adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, said on Thursday that unspecified negotiations were continuing and no deal had been reached with Israel so far. The Israeli military said they would be no full ceasefire, just tactical, local pauses for humanitarian aid. There were no immediate reports of a lull in fighting raging among ruined buildings in the north of the Gaza Strip. Israel unleashed its assault on Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. It was the single worst day of bloodshed in Israel's 75-year history and drew international condemnation of Hamas and sympathy and support for Israel. But Israel's retaliation in the Hamas-ruled enclave caused great concern as a humanitarian catastrophe unfolded. Palestinian officials said 10,812 Gaza residents had been killed as of Thursday, about 40% of them children, in air and artillery strikes while basic supplies are running out and areas laid waste by unrelenting Israeli bombardments. Earlier, a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the heads of the CIA and Israel's Mossad intelligence agency chiefs met with the Qatari prime minister in Doha on Thursday to discuss the parameters of a deal for hostage releases and a pause in Hamas-Israel fighting. In northern Gaza, Israeli forces fought Hamas militants and inched their way closer to two big hospitals as the plight of civilians in the besieged Palestinian territory worsened. Thousands more Palestinians were fleeing from the embattled north to the south along a perilous frontline path littered with bodies after Israel told them to evacuate, people on the route said. But many are staying in the north, packed into the Al Shifa Hospital and al-Quds Hospital as ground battles rage around them and more Israeli air strikes rain down from above. [1/10]Palestinians fleeing north Gaza walk towards the south, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in the central Gaza Strip, November 9, 2023. REUTERS/Mohammed Salem  Acquire Licensing Rights Israel says its Hamas foes have command centres embedded in the hospitals. In Paris, officials from about 80 countries and organisations were meeting to coordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza and find ways to help wounded civilians escape the siege, now in its second month. ""Without a ceasefire, lifting of siege and indiscriminate bombarding and warfare, the haemorrhage of human lives will continue,"" Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said before the White House announcement. Israel and its main backer the United States say a full ceasefire would benefit Hamas. Residents in Gaza City, a Hamas stronghold, said Israeli tanks were stationed around the area. Both sides reported inflicting heavy casualties on one another in intense street battles. Israel, which has vowed to wipe out Hamas, says 33 of its soldiers have been killed in its ground operation as they advanced into the heart of Gaza City. Thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge at Al Shifa hospital inside Gaza City despite Israel's orders to evacuate the area it has encircled. They are sheltering in tents in the hospital grounds and say they have nowhere else to go. The U.N. humanitarian office OCHA said Israel had again told residents of the north to move south, and that shelling around the main road continued, endangering evacuees. ""We saw decomposed bodies, people from civilian cars, civilians like us, not military cars or resistance men,"" Khaled Abu Issa said after crossing into the south with his family at Wadi Gaza. Another resident, who asked not to be named, said he had crossed with his wife and six children. ""You have to hold your ID card in your hand and raise it as you go past the Israeli tanks and then walk several more kilometres searching for a lift,"" he said. Southern areas have also come under regular attack. In Khan Younis, Gaza's main southern city, residents picked through the rubble and debris of a building destroyed by an Israeli air strike, hoping to find survivors, on Thursday morning, witnesses said. Tensions have also soared on other faultlines. Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah said it fired missiles over the border into Israel, and Israel's military said it responded with artillery fire. Ten Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in a raid on Jenin city and refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. Israel's military said it was conducting counter-terrorism raids. An unidentified drone hit a civilian building in the southern Israeli port city of Eilat, the Israeli military said, causing only light damage.

Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the HonestReporting article,"" Reuters added. Israeli government spokesperson Nitzan Chen said in a statement that Israel was demanding explanations from Reuters and the other news organisations regarding the HonestReporting article, saying what the report had described ""crosses every red line, professional and moral"". The Israeli prime minister's office said it viewed with ""utmost gravity"" the suggestion that journalists working with international media had joined in covering the Hamas attack. ""These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics,"" it said. HonestReporting wrote on social media platform X that it was raising questions about news coverage, including whether the photojournalists had prior knowledge and, if so, whether the news groups were notified before the attack. ""We did not accuse Reuters of collusion,"" it said. ""We quite rightly raised some serious ethical issues regarding news outlets' association with these freelancers and asked important and relevant questions that everyone deserves answers to."" The Associated Press (AP), which was among the news groups named by HonestReporting, said: ""The Associated Press had no knowledge of the Oct. 7 attacks before they happened. The first pictures AP received from any freelancer show they were taken more than an hour after the attacks began. No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time.""
