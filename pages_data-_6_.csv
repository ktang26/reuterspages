REUTERS/Victoria Klesty/Illustration  Acquire Licensing Rights CHICAGO, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A new class of weight loss drugs is transforming the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could extend to equally hard-to-treat areas like substance abuse, according to speakers at the Reuters Events Total Health conference in Chicago this week. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said Eli Lilly (LLY.N) could begin selling its drug tirzepatide for weight loss, making it the second obesity drug in a class known as GLP-1s. The drug, Zepbound, is already sold under the brand name Mounjaro as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk's (NOVOb.CO) Wegovy, or semaglutide, was approved for obesity in 2021 and is sold as Ozempic for diabetes. Drugs in the class, which are also under development at a number of other pharmaceutical companies, are designed to mimic action of the GLP-1 hormone to regulate blood sugar, slow digestion and suppress appetite. Studies of Novo's Wegovy showed that it led to 15% weight loss over 68 weeks, while Lilly's drug, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, demonstrated weight loss of more than 22% over 72 weeks. ""This opens up really some dramatic new opportunities in terms of control of the satiety region of the brain, but also other regions where addiction might be controlled,"" said Lawrence Tabak, principal deputy director at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), during an interview at Total Health on Wednesday. He said NIH-supported studies are still ""very much a work in progress,"" and the drugs can cause side effects, but ""it does open up a whole new set of possibilities to control things like obesity, metabolism in general, perhaps other addictive conditions."" Drugstore chain Walgreens is seeing ""enormous demand"" for GLP-1s, said John Driscoll, president, U.S. healthcare at Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O). ""I think these drugs are going to change the way people experience healthcare,"" he said, while noting that reimbursement by health insurers has not yet caught up with demand. The drugs have U.S. list prices of more than $1,000 a month. ""As time progresses, you typically wind up with drugs that may cost less over time,"" the NIH's Tabak said. He also said the potential for lower overall healthcare costs should be considered. ""If you are able to get a better control of obesity in this country, the savings on the back end due to reductions in cardiovascular disease, and then, you know, related conditions will be quite vast,"" Tabak said. Much has been made of the impact the new weight loss drugs might have on consumer habits such as snack food purchases, but Driscoll said Walgreens has not seen that yet. ""If they do it's probably a good thing for U.S. health care and our population and we would happily adjust to what the consumers want to buy if that happens,"" he said. ""I think we are just at the cusp of understanding beyond obesity.""

REUTERS/Tatiana Meel  Acquire Licensing Rights MOSCOW, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Russian fuel producers have been told by the government to prepare for the scrapping of all remaining restrictions on the export of diesel and gasoline, three industry sources told Reuters on Thursday. Russia, the world's top seaborne exporter of diesel, introduced a ban on fuel exports on Sept. 21 to tackle high domestic prices and shortages. The government eased restrictions on Oct. 6, allowing the export of diesel by pipeline, but kept measures on gasoline exports in place. Overseas supplies of gasoline by trucks and railways are also prohibited. Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on Wednesday said that Russia was considering lifting the export ban on some grades of gasoline. ""They told the producers that exports will be opened up from next week,"" said a Russian oil company source who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of such decisions. Another industry source said the ban would be lifted next week. ""They promised to lift the exports ban next week. In regards to this promise, we have formed an export schedule and a plan for refining,"" said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. The Russian energy ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Diesel is Russia's biggest oil product export, at about 35 million metric tons last year. Almost three quarters of that was transported via pipeline. Russia also exported 4.8 million tons of gasoline in 2022. Another company source said that a gasoline glut had emerged because of the restrictions. ""It's a low season now; we can't sell so much on the domestic market,"" he said. Officials have said the ban would be lifted once the domestic market stabilises. Analysts had expected the restrictions to be scrapped after completion of the recent grain harvesting season. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Sunday said that Russia would continue an additional voluntary supply cut of 300,000 barrels per day from its crude oil and petroleum product exports until the end of December, as previously announced.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday will weigh final approval of JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N) $290 million settlement with women who said Jeffrey Epstein abused them, and that the largest U.S. bank turned a blind eye to the late financier's sex trafficking. At Thursday's hearing at 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff will consider an objection to the settlement by 16 U.S. states and Washington D.C., which said it could limit their ability to seek damages arising from sex trafficking by Epstein and his associates. Rakoff had granted preliminary approval in June, calling it a ""really fine settlement."" The settlement covered more than 100 women, led by a former ballet dancer known as Jane Doe 1, who said Epstein abused them. It followed embarrassing disclosures that JPMorgan ignored internal warnings and overlooked red flags about Epstein because he had been a valuable client. Epstein was a JPMorgan client from 1998 to 2013. The bank kept him on even after he was arrested in 2006 on prostitution charges and pleaded guilty two years later. JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. At the hearing, Rakoff will also hear from one of Epstein's accusers, Sarah Ransome, who has argued that the settlement is too small and does not explain how funds will be distributed. JPMorgan in September agreed to pay $75 million to settle related claims by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands. Rakoff on Oct. 20 gave final approval to a similar $75 million settlement between Epstein's accusers and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), where Epstein banked after JPMorgan fired him. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at age 66 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. New York City's medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and longtime associate, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in December 2021 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for him to abuse. She is appealing her conviction.

In ransomware attacks, hackers encrypt an organization's systems and demand ransom payments in exchange for unlocking them. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack. The Financial Times reported earlier on Thursday that the U.S. Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) told members that ICBC (601398.SS) had been hit by ransomware that disrupted the U.S. Treasury market by preventing it from settling trades on behalf of other market players. ""We are aware of the cybersecurity issue and are in regular contact with key financial sector participants, in addition to federal regulators. We continue to monitor the situation,"" a Treasury spokesperson said in a response to a question about the FT report. ICBC, China's largest commercial lender by assets, was beginning to restore services as of Thursday afternoon, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the ransomware attack, which paralyses computer systems unless a payment is made.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - China's Zeekr Intelligent revealed wider losses for the first half of the year on Thursday and cautioned Beijing could influence its business, as the premium electric car brand made its paperwork public for a stock market listing in New York. Zeekr, owned by Chinese automaker Geely Auto (0175.HK), had confidentially filed for its initial public offering (IPO) in December last year. ""The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals,"" Zeekr said in its prospectus. The filing confirms a report from Reuters earlier on Thursday, which said Zeekr was looking to make its IPO prospectus public this week. The company was aiming to raise more than $1 billion, Reuters previously reported, but is unlikely to breach the billion mark, according to one of the sources. The listing could mark the first major float in the U.S. by a Chinese company in two years, after the infamous delisting of ride-hailing giant Didi Global from the New York Stock Exchange. Didi had angered Chinese regulators by pushing ahead with its $4.4 billion New York listing despite being asked to put it on hold. The episode, together with an audit dispute between China and the U.S., stalled Chinese companies from seeking U.S. listings. Only six mainland China-based companies launched U.S. IPOs in 2022. Since then, however, Beijing has softened its stance towards companies looking to list internationally, unveiling a set of rules earlier this year to revive such listings, after the U.S. accounting watchdog and China solved a longstanding audit dispute in December 2022. For the six months ended June 30, the company reported a net loss of 3.87 billion Chinese yuan ($531.34 million), compared with 3.09 billion Chinese yuan a year earlier. It will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""ZK"". Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

"8","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fierce-fighting-gaza-city-us-says-palestinians-must-govern-gaza-post-war-2023-11-09/","GAZA/WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Israel has agreed to pause military operations in parts of north Gaza for four hours a day from Thursday, the White House said, raising hopes of a respite in more than a month of fighting that has killed thousands and stoked fears of regional conflict. The pauses, that would allow people to flee along two humanitarian corridors and could be used for the release of hostages, were significant first steps, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. But as night approached, there were no immediate reports of a lull in fighting raging among the ruined buildings in the north of the Gaza Strip. There was also no direct confirmation from Israel, which spoke more generally of measures that appeared to correspond to arrangements already in place. ""We are undertaking localised and pinpoint measures to enable the exit of Palestinian civilians from Gaza City southward, so that we do not harm them. These things do not detract from the war fighting,"" Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said. Israeli forces completely encircled Gaza City in recent days and the military has been allowing civilians safe passage along the main route south for three or four hours each day, with ever growing numbers of families opting to escape. There would be no full ceasefire for now, Gallant told reporters. ""We will not stop fighting as long as our hostages are in Gaza and as long as we have not completed our mission, which is toppling the Hamas regime and eliminating its military and governance capabilities,"" Gallant said. Taher Al-Nono, a political adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, said on Thursday that unspecified negotiations were continuing and no deal had been reached with Israel so far. Israel unleashed its assault on Gaza in response to a cross-border Hamas raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which gunmen killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. It was the single worst day of bloodshed in Israel's 75-year history and drew international condemnation of Hamas and sympathy and support for Israel. But Israel's retaliation in the Hamas-ruled enclave caused great concern as a humanitarian catastrophe unfolded. Palestinian officials said 10,812 Gaza residents had been killed as of Thursday, about 40% of them children, in air and artillery strikes while basic supplies are running out and areas laid waste by unrelenting Israeli bombardments. U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters he had sought a longer pause than four hours. ""I've asked for a pause longer than three days,"" he said as he left the White House. Asked if he was frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden said, ""It's taken a little longer than I hoped."" Earlier, a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the heads of the CIA and Israel's Mossad intelligence agency chiefs met with the Qatari prime minister in Doha on Thursday to discuss the parameters of a deal for hostage releases and a pause in Hamas-Israel fighting. [1/10]Palestinians fleeing north Gaza walk towards the south, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in the central Gaza Strip, November 9, 2023. REUTERS/Mohammed Salem  Acquire Licensing Rights In northern Gaza, Israeli forces fought Hamas militants and inched their way closer to two big hospitals as the plight of civilians in the besieged Palestinian territory worsened. Thousands more Palestinians were fleeing from the embattled north to the south along a perilous frontline path littered with bodies after Israel told them to evacuate, people on the route said. But many are staying in the north, packed into the Al Shifa Hospital and al-Quds Hospital as ground battles rage around them and more Israeli air strikes rain down from above. Israel says its Hamas foes have command centres embedded in the hospitals. In Paris, officials from about 80 countries and organisations were meeting to coordinate humanitarian aid to Gaza and find ways to help wounded civilians escape the siege, now in its second month. ""Without a ceasefire, lifting of siege and indiscriminate bombarding and warfare, the haemorrhage of human lives will continue,"" Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said before the White House announcement. Israel and its main backer the United States say a full ceasefire would benefit Hamas. Residents in Gaza City, a Hamas stronghold, said Israeli tanks were stationed around the area. Both sides reported inflicting heavy casualties on one another in intense street battles. Israel, which has vowed to wipe out Hamas, says 33 of its soldiers have been killed in its ground operation as they advanced into the heart of Gaza City. Hamas has long vowed to destroy Israel. Thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge at Al Shifa hospital inside Gaza City despite Israel's orders to evacuate the area it has encircled. They are sheltering in tents in the hospital grounds and say they have nowhere else to go. The U.N. humanitarian office OCHA said Israel had again told residents of the north to move south, and that shelling around the main road continued, endangering evacuees. ""We saw decomposed bodies, people from civilian cars, civilians like us, not military cars or resistance men,"" Khaled Abu Issa said after crossing into the south with his family at Wadi Gaza. Another resident, who asked not to be named, said he had crossed with his wife and six children. ""You have to hold your ID card in your hand and raise it as you go past the Israeli tanks and then walk several more kilometres searching for a lift,"" he said. Southern areas have also come under regular attack. In Khan Younis, Gaza's main southern city, residents picked through the rubble and debris of a building destroyed by an Israeli air strike, hoping to find survivors, on Thursday morning, witnesses said. Tensions have also soared on other faultlines. Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah said it fired missiles over the border into Israel, and Israel's military said it responded with artillery fire. Ten Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces in a raid on Jenin city and refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. Israel's military said it was conducting counter-terrorism raids.

The Israeli government demanded explanations from Reuters and three other news groups regarding the HonestReporting article which questioned their work with Gaza-based photojournalists during the Hamas assault. HonestReporting, which describes itself on its website as ""a charitable organisation"" with a mission ""to combat ideological prejudice in journalism and the media, as it impacts Israel"", said it was not accusing Reuters of collusion but was raising ethical questions about news coverage. ""Reuters categorically denies that it had prior knowledge of the attack or that we embedded journalists with Hamas on Oct. 7,"" Reuters said, responding to the HonestReporting article and subsequent allegations by Israeli government officials. ""Reuters acquired photographs from two Gaza-based freelance photographers who were at the border on the morning of Oct. 7, with whom it did not have a prior relationship,"" it said. ""The photographs published by Reuters were taken two hours after Hamas fired rockets across southern Israel and more than 45 minutes after Israel said gunmen had crossed the border. Reuters staff journalists were not on the ground at the locations referred to in the HonestReporting article,"" Reuters added. Israeli government spokesperson Nitzan Chen said in a statement that Israel was demanding explanations from Reuters and the other news organisations regarding the HonestReporting article, saying what the report had described ""crosses every red line, professional and moral"". The Israeli prime minister's office said it viewed with ""utmost gravity"" the suggestion that journalists working with international media had joined in covering the Hamas attack. ""These journalists were accomplices in crimes against humanity; their actions were contrary to professional ethics,"" it said. HonestReporting wrote on social media platform X that it was raising questions about news coverage, including whether the photojournalists had prior knowledge and, if so, whether the news groups were notified before the attack. ""We did not accuse Reuters of collusion,"" it said. ""We quite rightly raised some serious ethical issues regarding news outlets' association with these freelancers and asked important and relevant questions that everyone deserves answers to."" The Associated Press (AP), which was among the news groups named by HonestReporting, said: ""The Associated Press had no knowledge of the Oct. 7 attacks before they happened. The first pictures AP received from any freelancer show they were taken more than an hour after the attacks began. No AP staff were at the border at the time of the attacks, nor did any AP staffer cross the border at any time.""
